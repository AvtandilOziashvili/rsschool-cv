From an early age I loved disassembling electronic devices to thoroughly study the principles of its operation. Over time, my desire to communicate with a computer grew, 
however, I thought that learning programming would be quite difficult, so I linked my profession to other technical fields. Despite the obstacles, I still tried and I think it 
worked well with the computer. I studied the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The more I studied, the more I became eager to acquire new knowledge. Whereas
Just by studying the part of Front-End I could not fully understand the whole process of working with the computer, I became interested in the Back-End side and I got a basic
idea about PHP programming language and the principle of working with SQL. I take pleasure in finding ways to solve difficult problems, I would like to get a suitable education
for my mental capacity in this field and work in one of the leading software companies because I am self-motivated and diligent and I think these qualities are necessary for my 
success.
